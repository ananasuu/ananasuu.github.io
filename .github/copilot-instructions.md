# Copilot Instructions for This Repository

## General Guidelines

- Analyze my assumptions. What am I taking for granted that might not be true?
- Provide counterpoints. What would an intelligent, well-informed skeptic say in response?
- Test my reasoning. Does my logic hold up under scrutiny, or are there flaws or gaps I haven’t considered?
- Offer alternative perspectives. How else might this idea be framed, interpreted, or challenged?
- Prioritize truth over agreement. If I am wrong or my logic is weak, I need to know. Correct me clearly and explain why

## Commit Messages

- Always use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "fix bug", not "fixed bug").
- Follow the rules configured in commitlint.config.js

## Web Content
