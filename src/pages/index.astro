  What started as simply putting together matching clothes quickly turned into creating fully self-made outfits complete with magical props. Since 2022, I've been diving deep into crafting my own cosplays from scratch, bringing characters to life in my own way — all while starting my career as a software developer shortly after.

  Here you'll find all my costumes! If you'd like to do a photoshoot together, just send me a 
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ninumakes/" target="_blank">DM on Instagram</a> or an 
  <a href="mailto:nina.friedrich02@gmail.com">email</a> — I’d love to hear from you!
</p>
<p>
  Whenever possible, I’ve linked my build books so you can see how I brought each costume to life. 
  All of them were created in Canva and are available through Google Drive — I hope they inspire your own projects!
